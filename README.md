# arrayIntersection
O(|a| lg |a| + |b| lg |b|)

INSTANCE: One-based arrays a and b of positive integers. Denote the size of a by |a| and similarly for b.
SOLUTION: A one-based array c of positive integers, such that c contains exactly one copy of each integer 
that appears somewhere in both a and b. Thus, |c| â‰¤ min(|a|, |b|).
2.1. Give a worst-case O(|a| lg |a| + |b| lg |b|) algorithm solving this problem.
